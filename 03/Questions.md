# Q1
Write a function called cube_not_equal(x,y,z,N). This function gets three integers x, y and z
representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer N. You have to return a set of all
possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum i+j+k of is not equal to N. Here,
0 ≤ i ≤ x, 0 ≤ j ≤ y, 0 ≤ k ≤ z.
# Q2
An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted first. If a
new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged.
You have a list of N items together with their prices that consumers bought on a particular day.
Your task is to print each item_name and net_price in order of its first occurrence.
item_name = Name of the item.
net_price = Quantity of the item sold multiplied by the price of each item.
Input: The first line contains the number of items, and the next N lines contains the item's name
and price, separated by a space.
Output: Print the item_name and net_price in order of its first occurrence.
# Q3
Write a function called print_upto_N(N) which prints all the numbers from 1 through N without
using any string methods, as the following:
12…N
Note that "…" represents the values in between.
