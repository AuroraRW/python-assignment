# Q1
Write a program that prompts the user for some text (words). The program continues to prompt
for words until a duplicate word is entered (one that is already in the list). At this point the
program terminates and prints out all the words in an alphabetically sorted list one line at a
time.
# Q2
Write a function that accepts two strings. One is a search string (a sentence) and the other is the
word we are searching for. The function returns the number of times the word is found in the sentence.
