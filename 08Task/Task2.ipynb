    "You are asked to implement a cipher encryption and decryption functions. \n",
    "This cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.\n",

    "Example \n",
    "To pass an encrypted message from one person to another, it is first necessary that both parties have the 'key' for the cipher, so that the sender may encrypt it and the receiver may decrypt it. For the cipher, the key is the number of characters to shift the cipher alphabet.\n",
